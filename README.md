# vocab-writer (WIP)

## Introduction

What does one do during revision breaks? I decided to start building a vocabulary retention app, mainly to try out Vue.js. I had primarily used React before, with a few sprinkles of Angular here and there, and wanted to try something new.

The idea behind this application is to help users take note of words that they didn't previously know or don't often use and be mindful of these words when writing any new piece of text.

Through building this app to a relatively complete stage, I also hope to be able to discuss my thoughts on Vue vs React in more detail, hopefully for a future blog post.

## Try it out

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AyushSingh13/vocab-writer.git
$ cd vocab-writer
$ yarn install
$ yarn serve
```
